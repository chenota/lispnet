# LispNet

LispNet is a network library for Common Lisp meant to provide a solid foundation for all kinds of network-based applications.

## Documentation

There's too much going on to list here, so you can visit [the function docs](media/funcs.md) and [the error docs](media/errs.md) to learn more about what LispNet can do.

## Purpose

This library is markedly simpler than my other projects (see [AlexC](https://github.com/chenota/alexc) or [AlexDB](https://github.com/chenota/alexdb)) so you might be curious as to why I made it in the first place. I was initially inspred to create this library due to a network science course in school that I really enjoyed; the itch to explore some of the algorithms we discussed never left me even all this time later. Furthermore, creating this library allowed me to to dig into sides of Common Lisp that I've never interacted before and I truly feel like a better Lisp programmer having created LispNet.

## Future Work

I feel that I've reached a reasonable conclusion with LispNet's functionality for the time being, however the door remains open for future expansion. I haven't quite figured out what I want to do yet but I certainly want to do some sort of network project in the future and I will update LispNet to support my future project when that time comes.
